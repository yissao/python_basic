    "In Python, **tuples** are part of the standard language. This is a data structure very similar to the list data structure. The main difference being that tuple manipulation are faster than list because tuples are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2.1. Constructing tuples\n",
    "To create a tuple, place values within brackets:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "l = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "l[0]\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is also possible to create a tuple without parentheses, by using commas:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "l = 1, 2\n",
    "l\n",
    "(1, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you want to create a tuple with a single element, you must use the comma:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "singleton = (1, )\n",
    "```  \n",
    "You can repeat a tuples by multiplying a tuple by a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1,) * 5\n",
    "(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n",
    "Note that you can concatenate tuples and use augmented assignement (*=, +=):\n",
    "\n",
    "s1 = (1,0)\n",
    "s1 += (1,)\n",
    "s1\n",
    "(1, 0, 1)\n",
    "## 4.2.2. Tuple methods\n",
    "Tuples are optimised, which makes them very simple objects. There are two methods available only:\n",
    "\n",
    "&#10148; index, to find occurence of a value<br>\n",
    "&#10148; count, to count the number of occurence of a value<br>\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "l = (1,2,3,1)\n",
    "l.count(1)\n",
    "2\n",
    "l.index(2)\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 4.2.3. Interests of tuples\n",
    "So, Tuples are useful because there are\n",
    "\n",
    "&#10148;faster than lists<br>\n",
    "&#10148;protect the data, which is immutable<br>\n",
    "&#10148;tuples can be used as keys on dictionaries<br>\n",
    "In addition, it can be used in different useful ways:</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.3.1. Tuples as key/value pairs to build dictionaries\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "d = dict([('jan', 1), ('feb', 2), ('march', 3)])\n",
    "d['feb']\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2.3.2. signing multiple values\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "(x,y,z) = ('a','b','c')\n",
    "x\n",
    "'a'\n",
    "(x,y,z) = range(3)\n",
    "x\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2.3.3. Tuple Unpacking\n",
    "Tuple unpacking allows to extract tuple elements automatically is the list of variables on the left has the same number of elements as the length of the tuple\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "data  = (1,2,3)\n",
    "x, y, z = data\n",
    "x\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2.3.4. Tuple can be use as swap function\n",
    "This code reverses the contents of 2 variables x and y:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "(x,y) = (y,x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## <span style='background :red' > ðŸ“£ðŸ“¢Warning! </span>\n",
    "Consider the following function:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def swap(a, b):\n",
    "    (b, a) = (a, b)\n",
    "then:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "swap(a, b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "a is still 2 and b still 3 !! a and b are indeed passed by value not reference.\n",
    "## 4.2.4. Misc\n",
    "### 4.2.4.1. length\n",
    "To find the length of a tuple, you can use the len() function:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "t= (1,2)\n",
    "len(t)\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2.4.2. Slicing (extracting a segment)\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "t = (1,2,3,4,5)\n",
    "t[2:]\n",
    "(3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2.4.3. Copy a tuple\n",
    "To copy a tuple, just use the assignement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "newt = t\n",
    "t[0] = 5\n",
    "newt\n",
    "(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## <span style='background :red' > ðŸ“£ðŸ“¢Warning! </span>\n",
    "You cannot copy a list with the = sign because lists are mutables. The = sign creates a reference not a copy. Tuples are immutable therefore a = sign does not create a reference but a copy as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.4.4. Tuple are not fully immutable !!\n",
    "If a value within a tuple is mutable, then you can change it:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "t = (1, 2, [3, 10])\n",
    "t[2][0] = 9\n",
    "t\n",
    "(1, 2, [9, 10])\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2.4.5. Convert a tuple to a string\n",
    "You can convert a tuple to a string with either:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "str(t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "`t`\n",
    "```    \n",
    "### 4.2.4.6. math and comparison\n",
    "comparison operators and mathematical functions can be used on tuples. Here are some examples:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "max(t)\n",
    "3\n",
    "```"
